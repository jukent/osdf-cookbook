    "## Contextual Integration of NCAR/NOAA Environmental Data with the NOAA Water Column Sonar Archive\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through an end-to-end workflow to relate shipboard sonar backscatter (Sv) to local environmental conditions. We (1) open EK60 data from a public NOAA S3 Zarr, (2) gather co-located environmental variables from OISST and IOOS ERDDAP, (3) compute hourly mean Sv, (4) assemble a depth×time error map for reference, and (5) synchronize timestamps to produce an interactive line-plus-heatmap visualization. All selections (time/depth/frequency) and conversions are kept explicit for reproducibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Imports**\n",
    "   Load core libraries for data access (xarray, s3fs), analysis (numpy, pandas), plotting (plotly), and I/O.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Initializing the datasets**\n",
    "   Access HB1906 EK60 Zarr data from public S3; subset by time/depth, select 38 kHz, and mask bins below bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Access buoy data**\n",
    "   Define Georges Bank buoy coordinates, sample daily OISST SST at the nearest grid cell (±1 day), and download the model error map (`.npy`).\n",

    "5. **Downloading external error map for the specific location**\n",

    "\n",
    "6. **Helper Function: Mean Sv (dB)**\n",
    "   Convert Sv from dB→linear, compute mean, convert back to dB.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Group Cruise Data into Hourly Chunks**\n",
    "   Add an hourly label and split the EK60 dataset into per-hour `xarray.Dataset` chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Compute Hourly Mean Sv & Attach to `env_df`**\n",
    "   Aggregate Sv per hour and append results as a new column in the environmental dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **Build Depth×Time Error-Map DataFrame & Align Timestamps**\n",
    "   Construct a depth-by-time matrix from the error map, guard for size mismatches, and align `env_df` endpoints to the heatmap timestamps.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **Data Visualization: Synchronized Lines + Heatmap**\n",
    "   Plot environmental time series above a depth×time heatmap with shared x-axis; save interactive HTML output.\n"
