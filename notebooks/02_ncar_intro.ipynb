    "GDEX provides free access to curated data for research, with an emphasis on datasets which provide high value to NCAR and member university researchers. Additionally, GDEX provides value added services and tools to help scientists discover, access, and manipulate data. There is also an increasing empahsis on enabling users to stream data to their local computational environment or apply computations directly to data."

    "- Climate model simulations (e.g., [CESM](https://gdex.ucar.edu/gsearch/dataset-search/?q=cesm2))\n",
