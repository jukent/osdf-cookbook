    "## Overview\n",
    "Scientists collect data on the water column using sonars; NOAA Fisheries routinely use this technology to identify fish schools and estimate biomass for fisheries stock assessments. Because of their value to our nation, these data are stewarded at the NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. [NCEI's Water Column Sonar Data Archive](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/water-column-sonar-data) currently holds over 350 TB of data collected over 20 years in all areas of the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. A copy of these archived data are accessible on Amazon Web Services (AWS) through the NOAA Open Data Dissemination Program. \n",
    "\n",
    "Raw sonar files are complex and binary. To make them more accessible, analysis-ready and cloud-optimized, a subset of the data have been converted into [Zarr stores](https://cires.gitbook.io/zarr). The team is currently focusing on [EK60 sonar systems](https://www.kongsberg.com/discovery/products/discontinued/simrad-ek60/) run on the [NOAA Ship Henry B. Bigelow](https://www.omao.noaa.gov/marine-operations/ships/henry-b-bigelow) by the [NOAA Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC)](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/about/northeast-fisheries-science-center). NEFSC's main objective for collecting these data is to determine the biomass of Atlantic herring _Clupea harengus_, which contributes to the commercial lobster industry. \n",
    "\n",
    "You can explore the Zarr translated files using [EchoFish](https://www.echo.fish/), the team's AWS-hosted interactive portal for data exploration.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goals of the [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/cssi-cyberinfrastructure-sustained-scientific-innovation) funded **Sonar AI** project are to \n",
    "1. Fuse multiple decades of water column sonar data\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Develop novel self-supervised machine learning models to extract patterns from the sonar data across large spatio-temporal scales, and integrate with environmental and geographical information to classify clusters in the context of oceanographic and biologically significant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Engage the community by sharing results through knowledge graphs and open source workflows (like this!)\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the team will build cyberinfrastructure that supports a robust, community-driven analysis pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we will demonstrate the steps to integrate clusters detected from sonar data with temperature data pulled from a nearby ocean buoy.\n",
    "1. Read in sonar data from Zarr stores on AWS. We are specifically pulling in a set of data collected on the HB1906 cruise between October 12 - 14, 2019.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Aggregate the [Sv](https://support.echoview.com/WebHelp/Reference/Glossary.htm#volume_backscattering_coefficient) values into biologically relevant depth bins and calculate the [Nautical Area Scattering Coefficient (NASC)](https://support.echoview.com/WebHelp/Reference/Algorithms/Analysis_Variables/ABC_and_NASC.htm)\n",
    "\n",
